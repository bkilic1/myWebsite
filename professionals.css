              <h2>technical one-on-one courses</h2>
              <p>
                If you want to expand your technical knowledge in salesforce, either admin or developer skills, I provide <br>one-on-one courses. Please apply only if you:
              </p>
              <li>have some experience in Salesforce and looking forward for the next level, I don't cover salesforce basics in my courses. Frankly, no one needs to pay for a course for entry-level knowledge,
                they're all easily accessible at no cost and require less prerequisite knowledge to understand.
              </li>
              <li>want to get more technical in your career especially if you're admin.</li>
              <li>have willing to learn outside of the course as well.</li>

                I provide mock-up interview services to prepare you for the real interview.
                If you want to ace your interviews and get your dream job. Contact me!

              <h2>resume review and feedback</h2>
              <p>Most candidates get eliminated in the reviewing resume part. It'a crucial step for all levels of professionals. Your resume should be simple and readable, informative without being too clustered.
                I've read lots of resume and know exactly which criteria are game-changing.
