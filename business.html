                <h1>unlock efficiency & savings: outsource your salesforce needs to a multi-disciplinary expert</h1>
                <p>It's interesting how every role - be it an admin, a developer, or an architect - brings a unique perspective to Salesforce tasks.
                </p>
                <p><strong>administrator</strong> is usually focused on managing and customizing the platform to meet user needs.
                    They ensure the system is user-friendly, streamlined, and maintainable for everyday business operations.</p>
                <p><strong>developer</strong> is someone who builds and modifies the system, often coding custom solutions and integrations.
                     They need to ensure the system is optimized and can handle these customizations without impacting its overall performance.
                </p>
                <p><strong>architect</strong> is responsible for the overall design and structure of the system, ensuring it's scalable, reliable, and secure.
                     They look at the big picture and plan how different components of Salesforce will interact with each other and with external systems.
                </p>
                <p>So, when you outsource your Salesforce tasks to me, I don't just perform a single role. 
                    Instead, I combine the insights of an admin, the technical skills of a developer, and the broad vision of an architect to give you a holistic, 
                    robust solution that not only solves your immediate needs but is also scalable and future-proof.
                     This multi-disciplinary approach is what sets my services apart and ensures you get the most out of your Salesforce investment.

            <h2>new org creation</h2>
            <p>Plain and simple. If you have a new org and it's blank, you'll naturally want to tailor it to your business and implement your specific processes. This task calls for architectural knowledge and skills because there are several important factors to consider:</p>
            <li>What will the data model look like?</li>
            <li>Which integration pattern do I need for external services?</li>
            <li>What will my security model look like?</li>
            <li>In which processes should we opt for clicks instead of codes?</li>
            <p>The key point to remember is that once your new org is set up, it's mostly going to stay the same. Once data begins to populate and users start adjusting to the process, it becomes challenging to alter the processes and data model.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>existing org troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>Plain and simple is good, you have an organization that's semi-functional, frequently hitting limits and suffering from poor performance. 
                It's the end users who bear the brunt of these issues. The problems could be related to your data model, APEX, or automation processes. 
                Or perhaps, it's a mix of everything. Throughout my career, I've resolved countless issues, bugs, and reduced technical debt.
                 A little secret about me: I actually enjoy playing detective to solve these problems while many others dislike fixing someone else's work.
